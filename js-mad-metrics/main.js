// Write a script that reports on several different aspects of the user's browsing behavior. Since the metrics depend on scrolling, create a long, one-page landing page prototype to test this on.

// Add a button with position: fixed that the user can click to view the metrics collected so far. Metrics collection should be paused when this happens, and resumed afterwards. 
// You can display the results in a manner of your choice (alert, lightbox, etc).

// What percentage of the page was viewed
// Total Distance Scrolled

// Time before clicking Sign Up
// Time spent on page
// Time spent on each section of the page


document.getElementById("collector").onclick = function() {
    return alert("metrics yo");
}
